Version 2.4.0 David Hull (david.hull@openx.com)
  * Fixed several bugs.
  * When a new worker is started because a request is received when
    all of the existing workers are busy, it is now started
    asynchronously.
  * Workers are now monitored, and so gen_server_pool notices more
    quickly (and starts new workers if the pool size goes below the
    minimum) if they exit.
  * Allow some randomness to be added to max_worker_age_ms to prevent
    workers from all dying at the same time.
  * Added a gen_server_pool:stop interface to allow the pool to be
    stopped.

Version 2.3.0 Vikram Kadi(vikram.kadi@openx.com)
  * Added a new config parameter request_max_wait.

Version 2.2.0 Eric Kim (ekim@openx.com)

  * Support turning off stats emission by adding { mondemand, false } to
options
